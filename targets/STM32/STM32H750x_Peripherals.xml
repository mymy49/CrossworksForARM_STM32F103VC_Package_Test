This unicast address should be as specified in (ETH_MACA0HR) and MAC Address 0 low register (ETH_MACAxLR). When this bit is reset, the MAC only detects Pause packets with unique multicast address. Note: The MAC does not process a Pause packet if the multicast address is different from the unique multicast address. This is also applicable to the received PFC packet when the Priority Flow Control (PFC) is enabled. The unique multicast address (0x01_80_C2_00_00_01) is as specified in IEEE 802.1 Qbb-2011." />
